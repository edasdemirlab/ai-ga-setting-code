# Content
Each folder contains the data for a TSP instance. The names of the folders start with the instance index mentioned in the paper, followed by the instance name.

Example:
Folder name: 08_berlin52
Instance index: 08, Instance name: berlin52.

For more information on problem instances, please refer to the supplementary PDF file. The folders also contain the results used in the paper. The PDF file also cites to the original sources of the data.


# Code
The codebase contains the bi-objective evolutionary algorithm proposed in the paper. It is designed to work with the sample_data.csv in the main folder. To use the code, you must move it to the folder of the problem instance you are interested in.
